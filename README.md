### The functionality includes:

- Navigation between pages through Navbar.
- Amazing and simple responsive design.
- Ability to **add/delete** the phone.
- Get information about it along with Image, and browse through the phone list.

### Important parts of the project:

- Created my own database schema using Mongoose.
- Implemented GET, POST, DELETE requests.
- Managed error handling in the Backend.
- Implemented **Base64** (Content-Transfer-Encoding), to encode binary data from images and store it in the **database**.
- Implemented (**_Loading..._**) text, while the REST API
  request is ongoing and the app is waiting for phones data.
